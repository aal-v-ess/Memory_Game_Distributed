# Memory_Game_Distributed

The Memory Game falls into the category of games of mental ability, which consists of pieces with figures on each side.

Initially all the figures are face down and each figure is repeatable in every two pieces so that the player finds his match. Once all pairs are found, the game is over.

After the server is running, a game instance is initiated by inserting a player name and connectting to the serve on menu bar on top.

The ten best scores are saved in a file on the server side as well as a log of the games played.

Two difficulties are available but the hardest is running a bit poorly unfortunately.
